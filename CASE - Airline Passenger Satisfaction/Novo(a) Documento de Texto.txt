This is my entry for #MavenAirlinessChallenger. Maven Analytics Chris Dutton
Challenge here is to provide insights to improve customer satisfaction.

My Steps: 
1. Exploratory data analysis:
The main tool used in this step it was Excel because the data set is small and Excel gives us different tools that let us analyze the data easily.
2. Data visualization
The main tool used is this step it was Power Bi because is really nice to visualizations and self-service BI.

Follow final result, i hope you like it and i would like feedback to improve more and more since i need a lot to improve.
